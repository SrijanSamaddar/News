        KOLKATA: A disturbing trend of targeted highway robberies has emerged along the service lanes and backside stretches of EM Bypass, particularly under the jurisdiction of Anandapur Police Station. Since March 2024, multiple such cases have been reported, involving known individuals from the film industry, with the latest incident taking place on May 25, 2024 (Sunday).
        <br><br>
        The robbers often in groups of two or three reportedly intercept cars late in the evening or during low-traffic hours, particularly in areas with low lighting, poor visibility, and minimal police patrol. These attackers appear to operate on foot and choose isolated roads with early escape options, making it difficult for victims or authorities to pursue them immediately.

        Earlier this month, a city-based casting director was robbed near the service road behind a prominent residential complex in Anandapur. He was returning from a location meeting when his car was intercepted by a group of men who emerged suddenly from a dark side lane. “They shattered my side mirror and threatened me with a blade. They took my mobile phone and wallet. That stretch had no streetlights working,” he told Samvad 24x7. He was reportedly alone in the car. The FIR was lodged at Anandapur Police Station.

        In a separate case in late April, a Kolkata-based film producer, known for his independent projects, was allegedly robbed near the Ruby Hospital backside road. A group of men reportedly stepped in front of his vehicle, forcing him to stop. They then approached the car, threatened him, and fled with his phone and wallet. The producer later confirmed he was driving alone and had taken the road to avoid main bypass traffic.

        Most recently, on Sunday evening, May 25, 2024, another film producer was similarly attacked while returning from a post-production studio. Around 9:15 PM, several men emerged from a narrow lane and blocked his path. They quickly surrounded the car and demanded his belongings. The robbers made off with his phone, a gold ring, and some cash before escaping through an adjacent canal-side alley. He too was travelling alone.

        Several residents and commuters in the area have now raised safety concerns over the increasing lawlessness behind EM Bypass, especially in lesser-used shortcut roads that connect places like Kalikapur, Anandapur, and Ruby Crossing. Many claim these roads are practically abandoned after dusk, with little to no patrolling.
        <br><br>
        A senior officer from Anandapur Police Station confirmed that a pattern has been observed. “The suspects seem familiar with the geography. They’re exploiting low-visibility zones and escaping quickly using side lanes. We’ve increased night patrols and are analysing CCTV footage from surrounding areas,” the officer said.
        <br><br>
        The police have appealed to citizens — especially professionals returning late from work — to avoid isolated backroads, keep helpline numbers handy, and report any suspicious movement immediately.

        While investigations are ongoing, no arrests have been made yet.
